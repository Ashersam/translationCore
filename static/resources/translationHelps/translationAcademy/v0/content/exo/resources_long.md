In that case, the larger phrase is explained first, and its parts afterward.\n\n==== Translation Notes Examples ====\n\n> But it is to the extent of your hardness and unrepentant heart that you are storing up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath (Romans 2:5 ULB)\n\n  * **But it is to the extent of your hardness and unrepentant heart** - Paul compares a person who refuses to listen and obey God to something hard, like a stone. The heart represents the whole person. AT: \"It is because you refuse to listen and repent\" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])\n  * **hardness and unrepentant heart** - The phrase \"unrepentant heart\" explains the word \"hardness\" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])\n\nIn this example the first note explains the the metaphor and metonymy, and the second explains the doublet in the same passage.  \n\n\n\n"
