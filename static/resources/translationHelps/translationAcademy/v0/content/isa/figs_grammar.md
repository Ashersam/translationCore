"---\ntitle: Grammar Topics\nquestion: What is some basic information about English Grammar?\nmanual: translate\nvolume: 2\nslug: figs_grammar\ndependencies:  \nstatus:  finished\ntags: \nrecommended: \noriginal_url: https://door43.org/en/ta/translate/grammar\ncredits: \n---\nGrammar has two main parts: words and structure. Structure involves how we put words together to form phrase, clauses, and sentences.\n\n**Parts of Speech** - All words in a language belong to a category called a  part of speech.  (See: [Parts of Speech](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_partsofspeech.md))\n\n**Sentences** -  When we speak, we organize our thoughts in sentences. A sentence usually has a complete thought about an event or a situation or state of being. (See: [Sentence Structure](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_sentences.md))\n\n  * Sentences can be statements, questions, commands or exclamations. (See: [Exclamations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_sentencetypes.md))\n  * Sentences can have more than one clause. (See: [Sentence Structure](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_sentences.md))\n  * Some languages have both active and  passive sentences (See: [Active or Passive](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_activepassive.md))\n\n**Possession** - This shows that there is a relationship between two nouns. In English it is marked with \"of\" as in \"the love of God,\" or with \"'s\" as in \"God's love,\" or with a possessive pronoun as in \"his love.\" (See [Possession](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_possession.md))\n\n**Quotations** -  A quotation is a report of what someone else has said.  \n\n  * Quotations normally have two parts: Information about who said something and what the person said. (See: [Quotations and Quote Margins](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_quotations.md)) \n  * Quotations can be either direct quotes or indirect quotes  (See: [Direct and Indirect Quotations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_quotations.md)) \n  * Quotes can have quotes within them (See: [Quotes within Quotes](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_quotesinquotes.md))  \n  * Quotes can be marked to make it easy for readers to understand who said what. (See [Quote Markings](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_quotemarks.md))\n\n"
