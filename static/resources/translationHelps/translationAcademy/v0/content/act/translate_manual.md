Some of the principles of translation in this manual also apply to Gateway Language translation. For specific instruction on how to translate the set of translation tools for Gateway Languages, however, please see the Gateway Language Manual. It will be very helpful to study many of these modules before starting any type of translation project. Other modules, such as the ones about grammar, are only needed for \"just-in-time\" learning.\n\n\nSome highlights in the Translation Manual:\n\n  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:guidelines_intro]] - defining a good translation\n  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_process]] - how to achieve a good translation\n  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:choose_team]] - some items to consider before starting a translation project\n  * [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translation_difficulty]] - what to start translating\n\n\n\n"
