"---\ntitle: Hendiadys\nquestion: What is hendiadys and how can I translate phrases that have it?\nmanual: translate\nvolume: 2\nslug: figs_hendiadys\ndependencies: [\"figs_intro\", \"figs_partsofspeech\"]\nstatus:  finished\ntags: \nrecommended: [\"figs_doublet\"]\noriginal_url: https://door43.org/en/ta/translate/hendiadys\ncredits: \n---\nHendiadys is when a speaker makes a single idea more forceful by connecting two nouns or adjectives with \"and\" when one of the words actually describes the other.\n\n### Description\n\nHendiadys is when a speaker expresses a single idea by connecting two words with \"and\" when one of the words actually describes the other.\n>his own __kingdom and glory__ (1 Thessalonians 2:12 ULB)\n\nThough \"kingdom\" and \"glory\" are both nouns, \"glory\" actually tells what kind of kingdom it is: it is a kingdom of glory or a glorious kingdom.\n\n#### Reasons this is a translation issue\n\n  * Often hendiadys has an abstract noun. Some languages may not have a noun with the same meaning.\n  * Some languages do not use hendiadys, so people may not understand that one word describes the other. \n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n>for I will give you __words and wisdom__ (Luke 21:15 ULB)\n\n\"Words\" and \"wisdom\" are nouns, but in this figure of speech \"wisdom\" describes \"words.\"\n>if you are willing and obedient (Isaiah 1:19 ULB)\n\n\"Willing\" and \"obedient\" are adjectives, but \"willing\" describes \"obedient.\"\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nIf the hendiadys would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider using it. If not, here are other options:\n\n  1. Substitute one noun with an adjective that means the same thing.\n  1. Substitute one noun with a phrase that means the same thing.\n  1.
