"---\ntitle: Exclusive \"We\"\nquestion: What is exclusive \"we\"?\nmanual: translate\nvolume: 2\nslug: figs_exclusive\ndependencies: [\"figs_pronouns\"]\nstatus:  finished\ntags: \nrecommended: [\"figs_inclusive\"]\noriginal_url: https://door43.org/en/ta/translate/exclusive\ncredits: \n---\nSome languages have more than one form of \"we\": an inclusive form that means \"I and you\" and an exclusive form that means \"I and someone else but not you.\" Translators whose language has separate exclusive and inclusive forms for \"we\" will need to understand what the speaker meant so they can decide which form of \"we\" to use.\n\n### Description\n\nSome languages have more than one form of \"we\": an **inclusive** form that means \"I and you\" and an **exclusive** form that means \"I and someone else but __not you__.\" The exclusive form excludes the person being spoken to. This is also true for \"us,\" \"our,\" \"ours,\" and \"ourselves.\" Some languages have inclusive forms and exclusive forms for each of these. \n\nSee the pictures. The people on the right are the people that the speaker is talking to. The yellow highlight shows who the inclusive \"we\" and the exclusive \"we\" refer to. \n\n![](http://cdn.door43.org/ta/jpg/vocabulary/we_us_inclusive.jpg)\n\n![](http://cdn.door43.org/ta/jpg/vocabulary/we_us_exclusive.jpg)\n\n#### Reason this is a translation issue\n\nThe Bible was first written in the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek languages. Like English, these languages do not have separate exclusive and inclusive forms for \"we\". Translators whose language has separate exclusive and inclusive forms of \"we\" will need to understand what the speaker meant so they can decide which form of \"we\" to use. \n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n>Forgive __us__ __our__ sins (Luke 11:4 ULB)\n\nGod has no sins to forgive; so languages that have exclusive forms of \"we\" and \"us\" would use the exclusive forms in this verse.\n\n>__we__ have seen, and bear witness, and declare to you the eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us (1 John 1:2 ULB)\n\nJohn is telling people who have not seen Jesus what he and the other apostles have seen. So languages that have exclusive forms of \"we\" and \"us\" would use the exclusive forms in this verse.\n"
