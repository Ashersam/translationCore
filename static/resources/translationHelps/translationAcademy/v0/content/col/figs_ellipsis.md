"---\ntitle: Ellipsis\nquestion: What is ellipsis?\nmanual: translate\nvolume: 2\nslug: figs_ellipsis\ndependencies: [\"figs_intro\", \"figs_sentences\"]\nstatus:  finished\ntags: \nrecommended: \noriginal_url: https://door43.org/en/ta/translate/ellipsis\ncredits: \n---\nEllipsis is where a speaker or writer leaves one or more words out of a sentence because he knows that the hearer or reader will understand the meaning of the sentence and fill in the words in his mind when he hears or reads the words that are there.\n\n### Description\n\nEllipsis is where one or more words are left out of the sentence because the sentence can be understood without them. The information that is omitted has usually already been stated in a preceding sentence or phrase.\n\n>the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous (Psalm 1:5)\n\nThis is ellipsis because \"sinners in the assembly of the righteous\" is not a complete sentence. The speaker assumes that the hearer will understand what it is that sinners will not do in the assembly of the righteous.\n\n**Reason this is a translation issue:** Readers who see incomplete sentences or phrases may not know what the missing information is.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n>when the blind man was near, Jesus asked him, \"What do you want me to do for you?\" He said, \"Lord, __that I might receive my sight__.\" (Luke 18:40-41 ULB)\n\nThe man answered in an incomplete sentence because he wanted to be polite by giving Jesus only as much information as necessary. He did not say that he wanted Jesus to heal him, because he knew that Jesus would understand that if he wanted to receive his sight, Jesus would have to heal him. \n>He makes Lebanon skip like a calf __and Sirion like a young ox__. (Psalm 29:6 ULB)\n\nThe writer wants his words to be few and to make good poetry. He did not say that Yahweh makes Sirion skip like a young ox because he knew that his readers could fill in the information themselves.\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nIf ellipsis would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider using it. If not, here is another option:\n\n  1. Add the missing words to the incomplete phrase or sentence.\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1. Add the missing words to the incomplete phrase or sentence.\n\n  * **the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor __sinners in the assembly__ of the righteous** (Psalm 1:5)\n      * \"the wicked will not stand in the judgment, and __sinners will not stand in the assembly__ of the righteous\"\n\n  * **when the blind man was near, Jesus asked him, \"What do you want me to do for you?\" He said, \"Lord, __that I might receive my sight__.\"** (Luke 18:40-41)\n      * \"when the blind man was near, Jesus asked him, 'What do you want me to do for you?' He said, 'Lord, I want you to heal me that I might receive my sight.'\"\n\n  * **He makes Lebanon skip like a calf __and Sirion like a young ox__.** (Psalm 29:6)\n      * \"He makes Lebanon skip like a calf, and he makes Sirion skip like a young ox.\"\n\n\n"
