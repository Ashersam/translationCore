"---\ntitle: Translating Son and Father\nquestion: Why are these concepts important in referring to God?\nmanual: translate\nvolume: 2\nslug: guidelines_sonofgodprinciples\ndependencies:  [\"guidelines_faithful\", \"guidelines_sonofgod\"]\nstatus: Review\ntags: \nrecommended: \noriginal_url: https://door43.org/en/ta/workbench/translate/sonofgodprinciples\ncredits: \n---\nDoor43 supports Bible translations that represent these concepts when they refer to God.\n\n### Biblical Witness\n\n**\"Father\" and \"Son\" are names that God calls himself in the Bible.** The Bible shows that God called Jesus his Son:\n\n>After he was baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water, and... a voice came out of the heavens saying, \"__This is my beloved Son__. I am very pleased with him.\" (Matthew 3:16-17 ULB)\n\nThe Bible shows that Jesus called God his Father.\n\n>Jesus said, \"I praise you __Father__, Lord of heaven and earth,... no one knows the __Son__ except the __Father__, and no one knows the __Father__ except the __Son__\" (Matthew 11:25-27 ULB) (See also: John 6:26-57 ULB)\n\nChristians have found that \"Father\" and \"Son\" are the ideas that most essentially describe the eternal relationship of the First and Second Persons of the Trinity to each other. The Bible indeed refers to them in various ways, but no other terms reflect the kind of eternal love and intimacy between these Persons, nor the interdependent eternal relationship between them.\n\nJesus referred to God in the following terms:\n> Baptize them into __the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit__. (Matthew 28:19 ULB)\n\nThe intimate, loving relationship between the Father and the Son is eternal.\n\n>no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son. (Luke 10:22 ULB)\n\n>Jesus said, \"Father, glorify your Son so that the Son may glorify you... I glorified you on the earth,... Now Father, glorify me... with the glory that __I had with you before the world was created__.\" (John 17:1-5 ULB)\n\n>The Father __loves__ the Son. (John 3:35-36; 5:19-20 ULB)\n\n>I __love__ the Father, I do what the Father commands me, just as he gave me the commandment. (John 14:31 ULB)\n\n### Human Relationships\n\n**Human fathers and sons are not perfect, but the Bible still uses those terms for the Father and Son, who are perfect.**\n\nJust as today, human father-son relationships during Bible times were never as loving or perfect as the relationship between Jesus and his Father. But this does not mean that the translator should avoid the concepts of father and son. The scriptures use these terms to refer to God, the perfect Father and Son, as well as to sinful human fathers and sons. In referring to God as Father and Son, choose words in your language that are widely used and refer to a human \"father\" and \"son.\"\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\n  1. Think through all the possibilities that your language has to translate the words \"son\" and \"father.\" Determine which words in your language best represent the divine \"Son\" and \"Father.\"\n  1. If your language has more than one word for \"son,\" use the word that has the closest meaning to \"only son\" (or \"first son\" if necessary).\n  1. If your language has more than one word for \"father,\" use the word that has the closest meaning to \"birth father,\" rather than \"adoptive father.\"\n\nSee *God the Father* and *Son of God* pages in [translationWords](https://unfoldingword.org/en/?resource=translation-words) for help translating \"Father\" and \"Son.\"\n"
