"---\ntitle: Hebrew Months\nquestion: What are the Hebrew months?\nmanual: translate\nvolume: 2\nslug: translate_hebrewmonths\ndependencies: \nstatus:  finished\ntags: \nrecommended: [\"translate_ordinal\"]\noriginal_url: https://door43.org/en/ta/workbench/translate/hebrewmonths\ncredits: \n---\n\n### Description \n\nThe Hebrew calendar used in the Bible has twelve months. Unlike the western calendar, its first month begins  in the spring of the northern hemisphere. Sometimes a month is called by its name (Abib, Ziv, Sivan), and sometimes it is called by its order in the Hebrew calendar year (first month, second month, third month). \n\n#### Reasons this is a translation issue \n\n* Readers may be surprised to read of months that they have never heard of, and they may wonder how those months correspond to the months they use.\n* Readers may not realize that phrases such as \"the first month\" or \"the second month\" refer to the first or second month of the Hebrew calendar, not some other calendar.\n* Readers may not know when the first month of the Hebrew calendar begins.\n* The scripture may tell about something happening in a certain month, but readers will not be able to fully understand what is said about it if they do not know what season of the year that was.\n\n#### List of Hebrew Months  \nThis is a list of the Hebrew months with information about them that may be helpful in the translation.\n\n**Abib** - (This month is called **Nisan** after the Babylonian exile) - This is the first month of the Hebrew calendar.

(Exodus 12:18 ULB)\n\n#### Translation Strategies \nYou may need to make some information about the months explicit.

Use the months that people know. \n1. State clearly what season the month occurred in. \n1. Refer to the time in terms of the season rather than in terms of the month. (If possible, use a footnote to show the Hebrew month and day.)\n\n#### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied \n\nThe examples below use these two verses.\n\n  * **At that time, you will appear before me in __the month of Abib__, which is fixed for this purpose. It was in this month that you came out from Egypt.** (Exodus 23:15 ULB)\n  * **It will always be a statute for you that in __the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month,__ you must humble yourselves and do no work** (Leviticus 16:29 ULB)\n\n1.
