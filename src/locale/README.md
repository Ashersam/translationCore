# translationCore Locale

The files in this directory represent the localized application strings.

## File Name Syntax

Files in this directory should be named in the following format.
Deviation from this format will prevent that locale from loading.

```text
  [Language Name]-[locale_REGION].json
  e.g.
  English-en_US.json
```

Files exported from the [Crowdin Project](https://crowdin.com/project/translationcore/)
will already be named in the correct format.
